# Stock Price Prediction
Programs for stock price prediction

* **StockPricePrediction_v1_xgboost.ipynb**:
	* Predict stock price in next day using XGBoost
    * Given prices and other features for the last N days, we do prediction for day N+1
	* Here we split 3 years of data into train(60%), dev(20%) and test(20%)
	* Doesn't work well, likely because data is not normalized
